Project Title: "VE: A Lightweight Text Editor built in C"

Introduction/Overview:
Brief Summary: VE is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor built using the C programming language. The project aims to create a simple, fast, and efficient text editor that supports basic text editing functionalities, making it suitable for quick editing tasks directly from the terminal. The editor will be designed with performance and minimalism in mind, catering to users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI) over graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Background: Text editors are essential tools for developers and system administrators. While there are many advanced text editors available, there is a need for a minimalist editor that is easy to use, has a small footprint, and can be quickly invoked from the command line. VE addresses this need by providing a basic yet powerful text editor that focuses on core editing functionalities without unnecessary bloat.

Objectives: A minimal and easy to use terminal text editor .
